# Applied Capstone Project
This is in fulfillment of my requirements for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. 

* GitHub link to complete code: click [here](https://github.com/flinksey/capstoneforcoursera/blob/main/Applied%20Capstone%20Project%20(Complete%20Code).ipynb)  

* **[Recommended]** Nbviewer link to complete code: click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/flinksey/capstoneforcoursera/blob/main/Applied%20Capstone%20Project%20%28Complete%20Code%29.ipynb#top) on nbviewer because it just looks a lot better and is overall more convenient, navigation-wise.

Note: For anyone else wondering how to hide your credentials like with the FourSquare API creds in the notebook, a peer reviewer very kindly shared this video so you might want to check it out: https://youtu.be/IolxqkL7cD8

Thanks!
