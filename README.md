# Applied Capstone Project
This is in fulfillment of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. 

I've uploaded my complete code in the notebook entitled "Applied Capstone Project (Complete Code).ipynb".
But I'd recommend viewing it [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/flinksey/capstoneforcoursera/blob/main/Applied%20Capstone%20Project%20%28Complete%20Code%29.ipynb#top) on nbviewer because it just looks a lot better and is overall more convenient, navigation-wise.

Note: For anyone else wondering how to hide your credentials like with the FourSquare API creds in the notebook, a peer reviewer very kindly shared this video so you might want to check it out: https://youtu.be/IolxqkL7cD8

Thanks!
